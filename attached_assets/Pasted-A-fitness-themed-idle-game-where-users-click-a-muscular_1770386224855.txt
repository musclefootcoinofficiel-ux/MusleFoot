A fitness-themed idle game where users click a muscular foot icon to earn $MUSCLEFOOT tokens. The app must feel like a premium Telegram mini-app (Dark Mode, Neon accents).

Technical Structure: Create a Single Page Application (SPA) with a fixed Bottom Navigation Bar containing 4 tabs: INFO, PLAY, BOOST, WALLET. Use localStorage to save all progress, balances, and upgrades.

1. [PLAY TAB] - Main Game (Default)

Visuals: A central clickable "Muscular Foot" character (with sunglasses and a crown).

Mechanics: Each tap earns $MUSCLEFOOT. Add a "+1" floating text animation at the tap location and a "shake" effect on the character.

Endurance System: A "Stamina" progress bar that depletes per click and recharges over time (1 unit/sec).

Alert Banner: A top sticky banner saying: "🚀 $MUSCLEFOOT IS LIVE ON PUMP.FUN! CLICK TO BUY!" (Link to be added later).

2. [BOOST TAB] - Store

Upgrades: * "Intense Training": Increases tokens per tap.

"Automatic Gym": Passive income (tokens per second).

"Pro Equipment": Increases max Stamina capacity.

Scaling: Prices must increase by 50% after each purchase.

3. [INFO TAB] - Roadmap & Tokenomics
