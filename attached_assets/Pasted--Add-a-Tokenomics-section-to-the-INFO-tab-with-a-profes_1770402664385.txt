"Add a 'Tokenomics' section to the INFO tab with a professional breakdown of the app's revenue:

1. The Vision: > - Title: '💎 Sustainable Economy'

Subtitle: 'Every SOL spent in the game fuels the $MF$ ecosystem.'

2. Revenue Distribution (The 75/20/5 Rule):

Create a visual breakdown (using progress bars or a simple pie chart logic) for all SOL revenue (God Packs, Refills, etc.):

💧 75% - Liquidity Pool & Buybacks: To ensure a stable and rising floor price for the $MF$ token.

🛡️ 20% - Marketing & Operations: To fund ads, server costs, and global expansion.

👨‍💻 5% - Dev Fund: To reward the team and fund continuous technical updates.

3. Token Info:

Display placeholders for:

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $MF$

Network: Solana (SPL)

Contract Address: 'TBA (To Be Announced)'

4. Styling:

Use a clean, financial dashboard look.

Each category should have its own color: Blue for Liquidity, Orange for Marketing, Purple for Dev.

Add a brief text explaining: 'Transparency is our priority. Smart contracts will automatically route these funds to ensure project longevity.'"                                                                                                  "Transform the Roadmap tab into a high-end visual timeline:

1. Design Style:

Use a vertical timeline with a glowing neon line (Cyan color) centered or on the left.

Each milestone should be a Glassmorphism Card (semi-transparent background with a blur effect).

Add a 'Glow' effect on the borders of the current active phase.

2. The Milestones (Content):

Q1 2026: The Awakening (DONE): >   - Launch of MuscleFoot Mini-App.

Basic Tapping & Energy mechanics.

Q2 2026: Hypertrophy (IN PROGRESS): >   - Muscle God Pack (10 SOL) release.

3. Interactivity:

When hovering or tapping a card, it should scale up slightly (1.05x).

Add a 'Progress Bar' at the very top of the page showing 'Project Completion: 45%'.

4. Aesthetics: > - Use icons for each phase (e.g., 🥚 for Genesis, 💪 for Hypertrophy, 🚀 for Mass Gain, 🏛️ for Listing).

The background should have a subtle 'grid' pattern to reinforce the tech/crypto vibe."
